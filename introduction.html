                <p><b>Personal  background:</b> Born and raised in the scorching desert heat of Tucson, AZ, my nomadic life began in the year 1977. I spent much of my youth bouncing between Davis-Monthan AFB in Tucson, AZ and Sheppard AFB in Wichita Falls, TX, until the day my parents sat my brother and me down to announce their decision to obliterate our nuclear family dynamic in 1984, leaving us in pure nothingness. A stable and calmer life ensued almost immediately. However, in 1988, my short-lived, stable-rooted life was once again upended by an announcement made by one of capitalism’s many hydras at the time. Without any means to resist, my mother gave in. During the summer of 1989, we painstakingly packed all our possessions into moving boxes, stacked them tall within a trailer, to commence our extensive journey across the southern hemisphere of the United States from Tucson to Charlotte, North Carolina. After our arrival in Charlotte, it transformed into our home and has remained so ever since.</p>
                <p><b>Professional  background:</b> The inception of my professional journey can be characterized by a choice that ultimately extracted a higher toll than its apparent worth. In the latter part of 2002, maintaining a comfortable household for myself and my family proved to be a substantial challenge. Recognizing that our government intended to showcase its strength by waging war on an abstract concept rather than a living entity, I enlisted in the United States Army. This decision led to my evolution into a distinguished PC Technician over eight years, four months, and twelve days of service, during which my passion for constructing computer networks blossomed. The fervor ignited as the military transitioned from analog packet switching to a fully digital signal network. My rigorous training enabled me to collect plenty of knowledge about how LAN and WAN networks transmit electric pulses or waves of light from one designated location to any specified destination, as long as it was permissible. This journey culminated in my attainment of CCNA certification. Following my time in the Army, I applied my skills in various Network Operation Centers, refining my skills. Driven by a desire for greater career autonomy—whether working from an office, home, or local coffee shop—I’m pursuing an AAS degree in Software Development with a Front-End Development certificate. Upon completion, my aspiration is to contribute to team efforts in constructing functional, responsive web pages.</p>
                <p><b>Academic background:</b> After graduating from Independence Senior High School in Mint Hill in 1996, I decided to take a much-needed year-long hiatus from formal education. In the fall of 1997, I embarked on my lifelong journey of pursuing knowledge. My initial endeavor to attain a degree began here at CPCC. Fast forward through all the minutia, I am currently dedicated to achieving my AAS in Software Development along with a Front-End Development certificate.</p>
                <p><b>Background in this subject:</b> Computers became integrated into my life during a time when screens merely displayed a green cursor, predating the convenience of pointing and clicking to initiate applications. My formal understanding of computers was acquired as I navigated mortar fire and bullets in the midst of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.</p>
                <p><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> I primarily use Windows and Android based systems, I have also explored Linux and MacOS on occasion.</p>
