                <strong>Personal Background:</strong>
                In September 1977, I entered the world amidst the scorching desert heat of Tucson, AZ, launching my
                semi-nomadic odyssey. The early years witnessed a rhythmic dance between Davis-Monthan AFB (Tucson) and
                Sheppard AFB (Wichita Falls, TX). A new chapter unfurled in 1988 post my parents' divorce, steering us
                on another expedition that found respite in Matthews, NC.

                The year 1996 marked my graduation from Independence Senior High, setting the stage for a diverse career
                path amid studies at Central Piedmont Community College. Although initially drawn to an AAS in
                Automotive Systems Technology, a change of heart redirected my course three quarters into the program,
                leaving the degree unclaimed.

                Exiting the realm of academia, I returned to the familiar grounds of work life, taking on the role of a
                McDonald's manager. Fate had its own plan, and shortly after crossing the threshold of 22, I stepped
                into the realm of fatherhood—not just to one but to triplet boys. This unforeseen twist expanded my
                world, introducing a juggling act of parenthood to the ongoing adventure.

                In the quest for stability and a less tumultuous life, I invested three years in finding my bearings.
                Yearning for transformation, I enlisted in the United States Army, subjecting myself to rigorous
                training to emerge as a lean, mean fighting machine. During my military tenure, my professional
                evolution led me to become a skilled network analyst, proficient not only in constructing radio networks
                but also in crafting intricate computer networks. The Army, more than a mere chapter, became a
                transformative saga, shaping me into a multifaceted individual prepared for any challenge that lay
                ahead.

                <strong>Professional background:</strong>
                The inception of my professional journey was characterized by a choice that ultimately extracted a
                higher toll than its apparent worth. In the latter part of 2002, maintaining a comfortable household for
                myself and my family proved to be a substantial challenge. Recognizing that our government intended to
                showcase its strength by waging war on an abstract concept rather than a living entity, I enlisted in
                the United States Army. This decision led to my evolution into a distinguished PC Technician over eight
                years, four months, and twelve days of service, during which my passion for constructing computer
                networks blossomed. The fervor ignited as the military transitioned from analog packet switching to a
                fully digital signal network. My rigorous training enabled me to amass a wealth of knowledge about how
                LAN and WAN networks transmit electric pulses or waves of light from one designated location to any
                specified destination, as long as it was permissible. This journey culminated in my attainment of CCNA
                certification. Following my time in the Army, I applied my expertise in Network Operation Centers,
                refining my skills. Driven by a desire for greater career autonomy—whether working from an office, home,
                or local coffee shop—I pursued an AAS degree in Software Development with a Front-End Development
                certificate. Upon completion, my aspiration is to contribute to team efforts in constructing functional,
                responsive webpages.

                <strong>Academic background:</strong>
                After graduating from Independence Senior High School in Mint Hill in 1996, I decided to take a
                much-needed year-long hiatus from formal education. In the fall of 1997, I embarked on my lifelong
                journey of pursuing knowledge. My initial endeavor to attain a degree began here at CPCC. Fast forward
                through all the minutia, I am currently dedicated to achieving my AAS in Software Development along with
                a Front-End Development certificate.
