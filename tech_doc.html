                        <li>NotePad</li>
                        <p>Notepad is a generic text editor included with all versions of Microsoft Windows that lets you create, open, and read plaintext files with a .txt file extension. If the file contains special formatting or is not a plaintext file, it cannot be read in Notepad. The image shown here is a small example of what the Notepad may look like while running.</p>
                        <li>NotePad++</li>
                        <p>Sometimes called NPP, Notepad++ is a free text editor for Microsoft Windows that provides additional features not found in the standard Windows text editor, Notepad. It was released by developer Dan Ho on November 24, 2003, and is still in active development.</p>
                        <p>Notepad++ is specially designed for editing source code. The "++" refers to the increment operator in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>Notepad++ is useful anytime you need to make significant changes to a text file.</p>
                        <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                        <p> Visual Studio Code is a free coding editor that helps you start coding quickly. Use it to code in any programming language, without switching editors. Visual Studio Code has support for many languages, including Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and more. Ready to get started?</p>
                        <li>Netbeans</li>
                        <p>Netbeans is an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It is used to develop applications with Java, PHP, C++, HTML and many other programming languages. The applications are developed using modules in Java. NetBeans can run on any operating system such as Windows, MacOS, Linux etc.</p>
                        <li>Eclipse</li>
                        <p>Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Java and other programming languages like C, C++, PHP, and Ruby etc. Development environment provided by Eclipse includes the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java, Eclipse CDT for C/C++, and Eclipse PDT for PHP, among others.</p>

                <header><h2>HTML Structure</h2></header>
                <article><p>The simple example shown above isn't pretty, but it is perfectly fine for illustrating a typical website layout example. Some websites have more columns, some are a lot more complex, but you get the idea. With the right CSS, you could use pretty much any elements to wrap around the different sections and get it looking how you wanted, but as discussed before, we need to respect semantics and use the right element for the right job.</p>
                <p>This is because visuals don't tell the whole story. We use color and font size to draw sighted users' attention to the most useful parts of the content, like the navigation menu and related links, but what about visually impaired people for example, who might not find concepts like "pink" and "large font" very useful?</p>
                <p>In your HTML code, you can mark up sections of content based on their functionality â€” you can use elements that represent the sections of content described above unambiguously, and assistive technologies like screen readers can recognize those elements and help with tasks like "find the main navigation", or "find the main content." As we mentioned earlier in the course, there are a number of consequences of not using the right element structure and semantics for the right job.</p>
                <p>To implement such semantic mark up, HTML provides dedicated tags that you can use to represent such sections, for example:</p></article>

                    <li>header: <header>.</li>
                    <li>navigation bar: <nav>.</li>
                    <li>main content: <main>, with various content subsections represented by <article>, <section>, and <div> elements.</li>
                    <li>sidebar: <aside>; often placed inside <main>.</li>
                    <li>footer: <footer>.</li>
